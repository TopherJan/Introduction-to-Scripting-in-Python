# Introduction-to-Scripting-in-Python
Introduction to Scripting in Python Specialization About this Specialization This specialization is intended for beginners who would like to master essential programming skills. Through four courses, you will cover key programming concepts in Python 3 which will prepare you to use Python to perform common scripting tasks. This knowledge will provide a solid foundation towards a career in data science, software engineering, or other disciplines involving programming.  Applied Learning Project Each course ends with a practical project utilizing Python scripting skills. The introductory projects will focus on typical core scripting problems such as processing dates and finding differences in similar files. Later in the specialization, you will learn to work with data stored in files to do sports analytics and data visualization. These projects include reading historical data on baseball, computing statistics from this data, and analyzing the results. Finally, the specialization culminates in a project where you will import economic data from the World Bank, process that data, and visualize this data overlaid on a world map.
